# BaseUnityProject

Anything in the Testing folder will NOT be copied over to a new project.  Files here are intended to be used for testing the Stash code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

How to create a new Unity Project:

-----------------
PART 1: Git Setup
-----------------

- Go to Github.com and create a new repository.

? Make the repository private
- Use the default Unity .gitignore.

- Copy the repository path (using HTTPS).  It should look like https://github.com/[username]/[project name].git

- Open SourceTree as an administrator.

- Open a new tab and go to Remote repositories.

- If there's a problem with getting repositories, do the following:
	- Right-click [username] and select Edit Account	
	- Ensure the following values are used in the Edit Hosting Account window:
		- Hosting Service: GitHub
		- Preferred Protocol: HTTPS
		- Authentication: OAuth
		- (try pressing Refresh OAuth Token if there's a problem with authentication)

- Clone the repo that was just created in Github.

- Set the destination directory to somewhere in the Projects folder.  e.g. if it's a unity project, set the destination to D:\Mark\Gamedev\Projects\Unity Projects\[project name].
	- The folder must exist and be empty.

PART 2: Copying the Base Unity Project
--------------------------------------

- Make sure KDiff3 is installed and can be accessed through the command line.

- Copy create-base-unity-project.cmd (located at the root of BaseUnityProject) into the root project folder.

- Run create-base-unity-project.cmd.  It will use KDiff3 to copy the files from BaseUnityProject to the new Unity project.

- create-base-unity-project.cmd can then be deleted from the new Unity project.
