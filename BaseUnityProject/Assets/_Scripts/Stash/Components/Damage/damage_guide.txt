Recommended Physics2D layers:

- Make the following layers: Players, Enemies, Other, PlayerAttacks, EnemyAttacks, OtherAttacks.
- PlayerAttacks collides with Enemies and Other.
- EnemyAttacks collides with Players and Other.
- OtherAttacks collides with Players, Enemies and Other.

Receiving damage:

- Attach the ReceivesDamage component to the gameObject (preferrably at the root of the gameObject).
- Receive damage directly by calling receivesDamage.receiveDamage(AttackInfo ai).
- The gameObject can have components that receive these events:
	void PreReceiveDamage(AttackInfo ai) { } - sent just before damage is subtracted from health.  The AttackInfo ai can be modified here (such as setting ai.damage to 0 to cancel taking damage)
    void OnReceiveDamage(AttackInfo ai) { } - sent just after receiving damage.

Creating Hurtboxes for receiving damage:

- Complete the above steps to get a ReceivesDamage component on the root gameObject.
- For each hurtbox:
	- Create a child gameObject.
	- Make Collider2D trigger(s) in the child to represent the hurtbox.
	- Set the layer to Players, Enemies, or Other.
	- Attach the HurtObject component.
- Receive damage by calling hurtObject.receiveDamage(AttackInfo ai).
	- Hurtbox will then call receiveDamage(AttackInfo ai) of the parent's ReceivesDamage component.
- HurtObjects can be disabled to disable receiving damage.

Dealing damage with hitboxes:

- For each hitbox:
	- Create a child gameObject (or not, but this is recommended).
	- Make Collider2D trigger(s) in the child to represent the hitbox.
	- Set the layer to PlayerAttacks, EnemyAttacks, or OtherAttacks.
	- Attach the HitObject component.
- Whenever a HitObject collides with a HurtObject (using OnTriggerStay2D), hitObject will call hurtObject's receiveDamage(AttackInfo ai).
- HitObjects can be disabled to disable dealing damage.
- HitObjects will store the HurtObjects (specifically unique HurtObject ID's) it collided with in a "hurt record".
	- If a HurtObject is already in the hurt record, it will not be collided with.
	- HurtObjects are automatically removed from the hurt record on OnTriggerExit2D event (but this may be unreliable).
	- The hurt record can be cleared manually by calling hitObject.hurtRecordClear().

Dealing damage with hitboxes and receiving messages for it:

- Follow the above steps to create hitboxes.
- The gameObject can have components that receive these events:
	void PreDealDamage(AttackInfo ai) { } - sent before dealing damage (and before PreReceiveDamage is sent).  The AttackInfo ai can be modified here for custom tweaking.
	void OnDealDamage(AttackInfo ai) { } - sent on dealing damage (after OnReceiveDamage is sent).

Order of events:
	PreDealDamage -> PreReceiveDamage -> (damage dealt) -> OnReceiveDamage -> OnDealDamage
